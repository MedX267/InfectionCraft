Infection Craft

This Python script is designed to demonstrate how penetration testing tools can affect files in a system, emulating virus-like behavior. It scans specific files in a directory and simulates infection by overwriting them with the script's content. The tool logs all actions and results to a file for further analysis.

âš  The goal of this script is purely educational and intended for use only in safe, controlled environments. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.

Features
âœ… Scans files with specified extensions (e.g., .txt, .exe).
âœ… Simulates virus-like behavior by appending script code to existing files.
âœ… Logs the results, including the infected files and timestamps.
âœ… Introduces delays between actions to mimic real-time behavior.
âœ… Checks for a safe environment before execution to prevent running in unsafe or production environments.

âš  Warning
This tool should only be used in a controlled and isolated testing environment. It is not intended for malicious use and must not be used on systems without explicit permission.
